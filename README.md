## 🛠️ Developer Notes

### 📌 Assumptions

* 🔐 **User authentication is intentionally omitted** from this project.

  * All non-external (local) messages are associated with a default `user_id = 0`.
* 📡 **API requests require all fields to be populated**.

  * For successful responses, follow the example `curl` commands exactly and ensure no fields are omitted or left empty.

---

### 🔄 What Would I Change?

#### 🎨 Styling Best Practices

* The frontend correctly leverages **slots** and **reusable components** ,however, **styling is fully hard-coded** within components.
* A cleaner and more scalable approach would be to:

  * Centralize styles in `app.css`
  * Introduce reusable utility classes or a design system

This would satisfy my personal standards more for frontend work.

---

#### 📚 Documentation

* Existing documentation is minimal and mostly uses the default `Laravel` comments made from `Artisan` etc.
* The project would benefit from:

  * More in-depth inline comments
  * Clear function- and class-level documentation
  * Explicit explanations of API contracts and data flow

---

#### 🔐 Authentication

* Adding authentication would remove the **ad-hoc handling** of local user messages.
* The current `user_id = 0` solution is a temporary, styled workaround.
## 📝 Personal Note

### 📖 Summary
This project represents my first experience working with **Laravel** outside of a guided tutorial. As a result, I significantly exceeded the original **3-hour time estimate**. Slowly I put effort towards gaining understanding of Laravel’s **MVC architecture** and routing mechanisms.

The experience was incredibly educational. As the day went on, things started to click, and towards the end of the process I was relying less and less on the assistance of AI and documentation and was able to solve problems independently. 

The `Laravel Bug` may have bitten me and more personal projects are stewing in the back of my mind.

### 📚 Learning Materials
Before starting this project, I worked through an introductory tutorial from the official Laravel documentation:

- https://laravel.com/learn/getting-started-with-laravel/what-are-we-building

I also referenced the standard Laravel documentation throughout development:

- https://laravel.com/docs/12.x

Additionally, the use of an **LLM** helped accelerate my learning process, explaining Laravel-specific conventions, behaviors, and framework features.
